		Title: 'The Da Vinci of Revenue Optimization',
		Excerpt: 'I’m currently working on their design system',
		Description: 'Maropost is a swiss-army knife of sales and marketing tools with their Marketing Cloud (MMC) being an all-inclusive set of digital marketing tools and their Sales Cloud (MSC) being an all-inclusive set of digital sales tools. I’m tasked with designing their design system. The reason why I call it the “Da Vinci” of Revenue Optimization is because: a) Maropost is in short a revenue optimization software b) Maropost possesses an AI named “Da Vinci” c) Maropost is a “Da Vinci”-like software because of its polymath-nature. Due to a lack of time, this article will show a preview of designs I’m currently working on for both the web app of MSC and the mobile app of MMC. With regards to the explanatory/descriptive/design-thinking element of this article — with time I’ll edit/update/add to this article. For now, I’ll simply show the “what”, the “how” and “why” will be shared at a later time.'

		Description: 'This program will guide the candidates through the concepts of blockchain technology, cryptoeconomics, and product design (UX). By completing the program, participants will be able to understand the theoretical underpinnings of how to apply design-thinking, systems-thinking, and exponential-thinking into the design of blockchain (distributed/decentralized) solutions. In addition, participants will have a deep and wide understanding of the social impact this technology can have. Participants will get to review UX case-studies within the blockchain space, learn more about existing solutions, and receive guidance from industry experts on how to design an effective blockchain solution. There will be a strong focus on Ethereum. '
